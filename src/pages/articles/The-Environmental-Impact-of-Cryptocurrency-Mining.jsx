        <h1>The Environmental Impact of Cryptocurrency Mining</h1>

        <p>Cryptocurrency mining, particularly Bitcoin's Proof of Work (PoW) model, has faced criticism for its energy consumption. Mining farms, often located near cheap energy sources, run high-powered computers 24/7. Studies estimate that Bitcoin's annual energy use rivals that of small nations.</p>

        <p>Ethereum's transition to Proof of Stake (the Merge) in 2022 reduced its energy consumption by over 99%, highlighting the potential for greener alternatives. Other blockchains like Solana and Tezos use energy-efficient consensus models from the start.</p>

        <p>Renewable energy mining, carbon offsets, and Layer 2 solutions (like Lightning Network for Bitcoin and rollups for Ethereum) are mitigating environmental concerns. As the crypto community innovates, sustainability is becoming a central focus.</p>

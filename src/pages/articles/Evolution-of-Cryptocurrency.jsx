        <h1>The Evolution of Cryptocurrency: From Bitcoin to DeFi</h1>

        <p>Cryptocurrency has evolved from an obscure concept into a transformative global financial movement. Bitcoin, launched in 2009 by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, introduced a decentralized form of money that exists independently of governments and banks. Originally viewed as "digital gold," Bitcoin pioneered the blockchain ledger, offering transparency and immutability.</p>

        <p>Soon, other projects like Litecoin and Ripple sought to improve transaction speeds and costs, but it was Ethereum in 2015 that truly expanded the crypto landscape. Ethereum introduced smart contracts—programmable agreements that execute automatically when conditions are met. This innovation paved the way for decentralized applications (dApps) and eventually decentralized finance (DeFi).</p>

        <p>DeFi platforms such as <strong>Uniswap</strong> (a decentralized exchange), <strong>Aave</strong> (a lending protocol), and <strong>MakerDAO</strong> (an algorithmic stablecoin platform) enable peer-to-peer financial activities without intermediaries. Users can lend, borrow, trade, and earn interest without relying on traditional banks.</p>

        <p>However, DeFi isn't without risks. Smart contract bugs, flash loan exploits, and rug pulls remain prevalent. Despite these risks, DeFi represents a radical reimagining of financial services, accessible to anyone with an internet connection.</p>

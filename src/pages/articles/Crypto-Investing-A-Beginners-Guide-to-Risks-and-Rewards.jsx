        Crypto Investing: A Beginner's Guide to Risks and Rewards

		Investing in cryptocurrency can be both lucrative and risky. Beginners should start with secure wallets (hardware wallets 	like Ledger or software wallets like MetaMask) and reputable exchanges (Coinbase, Binance).

		Key investment strategies include HODLing (holding assets long-term), dollar-cost averaging (investing set amounts over 	time), and yield farming (earning interest or rewards by providing liquidity to DeFi protocols).

		However, the crypto market is notoriously volatile. Price swings of 10% or more in a single day are not uncommon. Scams 	like fake token sales, phishing websites, and pump-and-dump schemes abound. Before investing, research the project's whitepaper, 	team, community, and code audits.

		Diversification is also critical—don't put all your funds into a single asset. And remember: only invest what you can 	afford to lose. Crypto's rewards can be great, but the risks are just as significant.}
